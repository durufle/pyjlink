Troubleshooting
===============

This page details common errors people run into while using PyJLink.  These
errors do not mean the library is not working as intended, but rather a fault
on the user end.  If you cannot solve your issue by following any of the steps
below, feel free to reach out.

Unspecified Error
-----------------

If you ever see something similar to the following:

.. code:: python

  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "pyjlink/decorators.py", line 38, in async_wrapper
      return func(*args, **kwargs)
    File "pyjlink/jlink.py", line 256, in open
      raise JLinkException(result)
  __main__.JLinkException: Unspecified error.

Then congratulations, you've run into a catch-all error.  This is a limitation
imposed by native C SDK in which there is a catch-all error case.  There are a
couple possible solutions to this, and they are detailed below.

Unspecified Error during ``open()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you see the unspecified error during ``open()``, it means that one of the
following is true:

  - Your J-Link is not connected to your computer.
  - Your J-Link is connected to your computer, but is currently held open by
    another application.

Unspecified Error during ``connect()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you see the unspecified error during ``connect()``, it means that any of the
following is not true:

  - The target device's chip name you passed to ``connect()`` is not the chip
    name of the actual target.
  - You're trying to connect to the target over JTAG when it only supports
    SWD.
  - You're trying to connect to the target, but the target is not plugged in.
  - You're trying to connect to the target using a J-Link that does not have
    the target plugged in under its "Target" port.
  - The connection speed is bad (try ``'auto'`` instead).

Unspecified Error during ``erase()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you see the unspecified error during ``erase()``, it means that your device is
not properly halted.  IF you're using a Cortex-M device, try setting the reset
strategy to ``JLinkResetStrategyCortexM3.RESETPIN`` to avoid your device's
application running when the system is booted; this is particularly useful if
your application launches the watchdog or another service which would interpret
the J-Link when erasing.

Unspecified Error during ``flash()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you see the unspecified error during ``flash()``, it means that either:

   - Your device is not properly halt.  While ``flash()`` attempts to halt the
     CPU, it cannot if the device is breakpointed or similar.
   - The device is locked, in which case you have to unlock the device first.

Unspecified Error in Coresight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you see an unspecified error while using a Coresight method, it means that
you are trying to read from / write to an invalid register.
