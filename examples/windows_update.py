# Automatic updating of J-Link software on Windows.
#
# This script demonstrates automatically updating the J-Link firmware to match
# the firmware provided by the J-Link DLL on windows platform.  This is
# particularly useful for automated testing infrastructure where the desire is
# to automatically role out upgrades of the J-Link software.  This would be run
# after the latest version of the DLL is installed.

# Usage: windows_update.py
